My recommended keyboard shortcuts for the GGPoker PC App

A simple HTML page documenting my suggested keyboard shortcuts for the GGPoker desktop application (for obvious reasons, there isn't one for mobile).

## Installing this cheat-sheet
- View locally (download the repo and you have an offline copy)
- View online (let github webservers do the donkey work for you!)
There are two ways to view my cheat sheet. Follow the traditional method of cloning a git repo, clone the repository, etc. or simply let github do the work for you and let it serve the page!

### Cloning/downloading for viewing locally
Accessing this cheat-sheet is as simple as opening a html page in your favourite browser. The index.html and associated images can be hosted on a web server, if you'd prefer, but this is not necessary. The repo can just be downloaded and the page can then be opened in the browser from your file system - the images are linked relative to the html page, so the page should be accessible immediately after the repo has been cloned.

However, you don't even need to download the repository, as detailed below!

### How to view online
- Simply go to https://rawcdn.githack.com/Nos78/ggpoker/main/index.html and the page will be rendered just as a webpage should! Nothing else needs to be done by you. And if you bookmark this link, you'll be sure to have access to the latest version of my cheatsheet (existing hotkeys will remain unchanged, else your cheatsheet might be out of date and you're entering the wrong hotkey. Should I make additions to the cheatsheet, the changes and version number will be stated on the page, for your ease of reference).

#### Technical explanation of serving webpages via github
The html page can be served directly from github. Usually this is turned off, github won't serve your HTML pages fully rendered, but instead serve the actual source code of the page. But you can turn this back on, and there are various methods with which to do this, not least by using github's sub-domain at https://raw.github.com

I've chosen to use https://rawcdn.githack.com/ which renders repositories content rather than serving repositories content source.
